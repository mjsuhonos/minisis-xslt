Minisis XSLT
============

This is a simple XSLT used for transforming XML in the proprietary export format from [Minisis](http://www.minisisinc.com) M2A system into the [Encoded Archival Description](http://www.loc.gov/ead/) (EAD) standard.  It exists because Minisis' purported "built-in EAD export" is of insufficient quality to actually *migrate data out of the system intact*.

We suggest using an Open-Source archival description system like [Access To Memory](http://www.accesstomemory.org) (AtoM) instead.
